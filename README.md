# Cleanup Jamboree
List of tasks for the January Data Cleanup Jamboree

---

This list is for all tasks we have during jamboree to attempt to get the data in order.   
There is so far no order to the list regarding importance.  

- When you start on a task, add your name in bold (double asterisk on each side) behind the task, so people know it's being worked on.  
- When you have completed a task, enter an "x" into the square brackets of the task to mark it complete, or ask someone with access to do this for you.    

- [ ] This is an example of someone working on a task (**Mo**)
- [x] this is an example for finished task
